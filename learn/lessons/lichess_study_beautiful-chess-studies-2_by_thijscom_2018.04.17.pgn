{ This study, the second in its series (the first part can be found at https://lichess.org/study/iDSPaPWA), is a collection of beautiful chess studies, where the assignment is to force a win or a draw. In these puzzles there is only one, often elegant solution achieving this goal. For checkmating puzzles, where the assignment is to force mate within 2/3 moves, see https://lichess.org/study/RdtICntn. }
1. f3 { The puzzles/chapters are listed on the left hand side above the chat window, and are sorted alphabetically by the composers of these puzzles. Each chapter represents a different puzzle. The solution, as well as a detailed analysis of the variations crucial to the solutions, can be found on the right hand side after completing the puzzle and clicking "Analyse". } 1... e5 { If you like these puzzles or have any comments, feel free to drop a line in the chat box on the left, or add this study to your favorites by clicking the little heart ❤️ below the board when loading the study. And as mentioned, do not forget to check out the other puzzle collections at https://lichess.org/study/iDSPaPWA and https://lichess.org/study/RdtICntn. } 2. g4 { As a sidenote, you might notice that some chapters have a *-mark, and some do not. Chapters without a * are fully annotated, with hints and guidance why other moves are wrong, while the chapters with a * are not quite fully annotated. (This is a rather time-consuming process.) } 2... Qh4# *

{ In this position, white is down a queen for a knight and two pawns. On the other hand, the black pieces are awkwardly placed on the back rank, and the black pieces have very few squares to move to. How does white use this to quickly force a draw? }
1. Nf6+! { Correct! White gives a check, further restricting the black queen, and forcing the black king to move from e8. } 1... Kd8 { As 1... Ke7? 2. Ng6+ immediately loses the queen, black decides that 1... Kd8 is his best chance. How does white continue? } (1... Ke7 2. Ng6+) 2. e7+! { Correct! The king and queen are forked by the pawn, and the knight on e5 threatens to deliver a fork on the next move if either piece captures on e7. } 2... Nxe7 { Black therefore captures on e7 with his knight, avoiding the loss of his queen. This however further restricts the black queen. What does white play next? } (2... Qxe7 3. Nc6+)  (2... Kxe7 3. Ng6+) 3. Kb7!! { Correct! This amazing, quiet move shows the helplessness of black's position, despite the considerable material advantage. Black's king is trapped, the knight cannot move due to a checkmate on c6, and the queen is struggling to find any safe squares to move to. } 3... Qg7 { Black finds the only move that does not immediately lose the queen (or loses to checkmate). What does white play next? } (3... Qh8? 4. Nf7#)  (3... Nf5? { (or any other knight move) } 4. Nc6#) 4. Kb8!! { Correct! Although white cannot yet exploit the positioning of black's pieces, this king move again demonstrates the helplessness of black's position. } 4... Qf8 { Black again has no good options, and decides to move the queen back to f8. What does white play next? } (4... Qxg5? 5. Nf7#)  (4... Qh8? 5. Nf7#)  (4... Nd5? { (or any other knight move) } 5. Nc6#) 5. Kb7! { Correct! If black does not try to win, white cannot force a win, and with best play by both sides we will soon reach a three-fold repetition. (1/2-1/2) } *
